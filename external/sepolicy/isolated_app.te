### This file defines the rules for isolated apps. An "isolated
### app" is an APP with UID between AID_ISOLATED_START (99000)
### and AID_ISOLATED_END (99999).
###
### isolated_app includes all the appdomain rules, plus the
### additional following rules:
###

type isolated_app, domain;
app_domain(isolated_app)

# Access already open app data files received over Binder or local socket IPC.
allow isolated_app app_data_file:file { read write getattr lock };

allow isolated_app activity_service:service_manager find;
allow isolated_app display_service:service_manager find;

# only allow unprivileged socket ioctl commands
allow isolated_app domain:{ rawip_socket tcp_socket udp_socket } unpriv_sock_ioctls;
