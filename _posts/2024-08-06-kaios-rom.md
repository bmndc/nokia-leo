title: Can I put KaiOS on other devices?
---
Short answer: we don't have enough publicly available components to create an exact copy of KaiOS, but developing another fork is doable. 

KaiOS is considered a proprietary product, which means only KaiOS Technologies, its shareholders, and business partners can access, modify, and build on the codebase. It's the choice they made for the business model and that [something we cannot alter]. But as KaiOS is derived from Firefox OS, parts of it, like Boot2Gecko, are under [Mozilla Public Licence 2.0], and KaiOS Technologies has no choice but to open-source the original work by the Mozilla team, along with any modifications made to it. Much of the operating system, like the Gaia apps, is still missing, making it impossible to build or port an exact copy of KaiOS on our own.

To build KaiOS would also need the device-specific drivers (HALs, or referred to as Gonk), because there's no point of operating systems if they cannot communicate with the hardware. Phone manufacturers are obligated to release the Linux kernel under [the GNU GPLv2], and [they sometimes do] &#x2014; along with the Gonk layer, which makes things like postmarketOS possible. Other times, they do not or are not able to (shout out to MediaTek), making things tricky if the device is too different from others that have been open-sourced.

Although the companies are not required to release any changes or additions made beyond the open-sourced modules, KaiOS has made some contributions to [the publicly available fork] and introduced new APIs. And since the partnership between KaiOS Technologies and Mozilla, employees who formerly worked on B2G and Firefox OS has also worked on the fork and modernised it, by updating the Gecko engine and integrating a selection of current web technologies. Building another operating system off the fork is doable (see [Capyloon]).

But you may ask, surely we can make an generic image file that we can flash on every device, [something like this], right?

ROMs for ARM devices don't work the same way as ISOs for desktop operating systems, because configurations are way too vary between devices (quad-core, octa-core, Cortex-A7, Cortex-A55 etc.) Often, phone manufacturers will work with KaiOS to get the source code, tweak it to optimise the OS on their phones, build the code themselves, then conduct some QA testing. The entire process costs a ton of money (which explains there aren't even any updates for already released phones.) Even Apple has to build IPSWs for each of their supported devices, but it benefits from having control over both the OS and the hardware.

KaiOS doesn't have some sort of generic ROMs that you can flash to get your phone half-baked. The concept was only introduced with Project Treble in 2017 and Project Mainline in 2019 on Android, and works by separating the operating system code from driver code of manufacturers. And even then [the result is less than ideal].

LineageOS and custom Android-based OSes are different, since Android is mostly open-sourced, and phones chosen by the community either have kernel source code released as required by GNU GPL/LGPL licences, or are similar to those that have been open-sourced. This, plus with a bit of work, make custom Android ROMs possible.

P.S. For dumbproof purposes, partition images under [here](https://github.com/bmndc/nokia-leo/releases/) are not generic, but are extracted from a certain device, specifically the 6300 4G.
