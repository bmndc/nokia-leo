This is the Brotli data compression library from
https://github.com/google/brotli.

Currently, we import only the Brotli decoder (the /dec/ subdirectory), not the
encoder (/enc/ subdirectory).

Upstream code can be viewed at
  https://github.com/google/brotli/tree/master/dec

and cloned by
  git clone https://github.com/google/brotli

The in-tree copy is updated by running
  sh update.sh
from within the modules/brotli directory.

Current version: [commit 33aa40220b96cf95ad2b9ba61dc8d7fd2f964f2c].

dec/port.h was patched to fix false positive warning in Brotli and a
corresponding change will be done upstream.
